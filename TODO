- autmatic testing 
- determine all valid color assignments in draw_nodes and draw_edges; improve docs
- set artist attributes interactively
- (potential) bug fix: in `draw_edge_labels` the angle calculation seems only to be correct if the the edge_label_position is 0.5  
- position node labels better:
